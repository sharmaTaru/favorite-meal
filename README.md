# favorite-meal
This website can find any meal for you. And you can see that meal's detail and save it as you favorite.

I have created a website which takes your input about any meal and find it for you.
If you wanna see the details of that meal you can click on the given button named Meal Details and you will be able to know the ingredients and instructions to make.
If you like any meal you can click on the button name Add to Favorites.
I have used TheMealDb.com for api.
I have used fetch method to get the meal.
I have stored favorite meals in localStorage so that they remain in the website even after closing the website.
I have stored the details of the meal in session Storage so that we can see them only when we want.
I have used some bootstrap to style my website and also use css according to my needs.
